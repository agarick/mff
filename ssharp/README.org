* S#

toy ("S#") syntax to c-syntax transpilation

- disclaimers ::
  - assignment is incomplete
    - binary operation does not repeat, ie. "u + v + w" fails
    - parsing is quite buggy
    - gives no output
      - must complete parsing first
    - does not recognise user input
      - only recognises [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L825]["test" variable]] in main()
  - documentation (comments) is not polished and somewhat haphazard
  - no automated testing implemented
  - at time of submission, *[[https://github.com/agarick/mff/tree/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp][submit branch]]* frozen @ 05 jan 2019, [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/commit/71085a6385ee4fb24b8f160a65bbbf368f6ab7b2][71085a6385]]

- code structure ::
  - outline
    1. transpile starts: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L734][init()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L822][main()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L825]["test" string]]
    1. test string is lexed: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L236][lex()]]
    1. lexed tokens are parsed: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L688][parse()]]
    1. parse() refers to [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L365][various parse_*()]], the results of which accumulate in [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L320][a global variable]].
    1. the global accumulation variable is traversed and printed accordingly: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L719][out()]]
  - *.(/mff/ssharp)/makefile*
    - first =cd mff/ssharp=
    - build: =make=
    - clean: =make clean=
    - run: =./transpile= or =make run=
  - *.(/mff/ssharp)/main.cpp*
    - single file containing all of source

- further implementation notes ::
  - a recursive descent parser has been attempted
  - the [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L776][Transpiler.grammar variable]] does not work as intended; it aims to inform a main recursive "parsing" function, but currently, the "grammar" has instead been hardcoded into the parse_*() functions.
  - please use the [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L24][DEBUG macro]] and the [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nprg041_ssharp_submit/ssharp/main.cpp#L825][test string]] to try out the incomplete transpiler.
