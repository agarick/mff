* mysh

basic linux shell (exec, cd, fork, pipe, redirect)

per https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/class-assignments/labs-assignment-2018.txt

- build ::

build dependencies: make, clang, libedit

  - first =cd mff/mysh=
  - build: =make=
  - build test: =make test=
  - run: =./mysh= or =make run=
  - test: =./test=
  - clean: =make clean=

- code structure ::
  - outline
    1. mysh starts: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/main.c#L14][main()]]
    2. "mode" of the shell is determined: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/main.c#L14][main()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L91][opt()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L288][loop()]]
    3. repl starts: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L266][loop()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L193][loop_body()]]
    4. input is read, variation depending on mode: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L266][loop()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L120][get()]]
    5. read input is parsed into tokens: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L294][parse()]]
    6. tokens are evaluated: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L459][eval()]]
    7. commands are spawned: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L330][spawn()]]
    8. next iteration of repl is readied: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/repl.c#L150][rinse()]]
  - data
    - [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/mysh.h#L40][line -> semi -> cmd -> word -> token]]
      - where "line" and "token" are strings and the structs between them are TAILQs.
      - the "->" refers not to actual membership but to a "conceptual" membership -- ie. from a "line" we get "semis" and each "semi" contains "cmds", etc.
    - the populating of semis, cmds, and words are done through [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L310][nested string splitting]].
  - redirecting
    - [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/util.c#L64][chop off]] any trailing substrings that [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L567][look redirectible]], and [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L162][behave accordingly]].
  - piping
    - each spawn is [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L335][given parameters]] describing [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/master/mysh/src/parse.c#L534][its place in]] the pipeline.
  - files
    - *makefile* - for =make ...=
    - src/ *main.c* - main function as entry point into *mysh*
    - src/ *test.c* - unit test implementations, and main function to run them
    - src/ *mysh.h* - struct implementations and function declarations
    - src/ *parse.c* - parsing and evaluating
    - src/ *repl.c* - looping, initialising, and finalising
    - src/ *util.c* - utility and helpers
    - *sample.mysh* - a sample non-interactive script - try with =./mysh sample.mysh=
    - *obj/* - compiled =*.o= files, not version-controlled

- miscellany ::
  - read: libedit used
  - style: allman indent, 72 char width, spaces not tabs
  - style: no particular linter used
  - testing: MinUnit "framework"
