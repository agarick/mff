* mysh

basic linux shell (exec, cd, fork, pipe, redirect)

- build ::
  - first =cd mff/mysh=
  - build: =make=
  - build test: =make test=
  - *run*: =./mysh= or =make run=
  - test: =./test=
  - clean: =make clean=

- code structure ::
  - outline
    1. mysh starts: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/main.c#L13][main()]]
    2. "mode" of the shell is determined: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/main.c#L13][main()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/mysh.c#L613][opt()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L253][loop()]]
    3. repl starts: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L253][loop()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L192][loop_body()]]
    4. input is read, variation depending on mode: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L253][loop()]], [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L120][get()]]
    5. read input is parsed into tokens: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/parse.c#L263][parse()]]
    6. tokens are evaluated: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/parse.c#L428][eval()]]
    7. next iteration of repl is readied: [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/blob/nswi015_mysh_phase1/mysh/repl.c#L150][rinse()]]
  - *makefile* - for =make ...=
  - *src/main.c* - main function as entry point into *mysh*
  - *src/test.c* - unit test implementations, and main function to run them
  - *src/mysh.h* - struct implementations and function declarations
  - *src/parse.c* - parsing and evaluating
  - *src/repl.c* - looping, initialising, and finalising
  - *src/util.c* - utility and helpers
  - *sample.mysh* - a sample non-interactive script - try with =./mysh sample.mysh=
  - *obj/* - compiled =*.o= files, not version-controlled

- miscellany ::
  - read: libedit used
  - style: allman indent, 72 char width, spaces not tabs
  - style: no particular linter used
  - testing: MinUnit "framework"
  - testing: coverage incomplete, partially failing on lab computers
